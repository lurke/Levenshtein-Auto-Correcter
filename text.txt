Algorithms and data structures lie at the heart of computer science. Some of the algorithms and data structures we've shown you so far in this course, such as Google's PageRank algorithm or RSA encryption, are examples of how more efficient or more powerful algorithms have literally changed the world we live in. To give you a taste of what further classes in CS are like, we require that a substantial part of your project involves at least one interesting algorithm or data structure.
